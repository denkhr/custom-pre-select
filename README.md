# Custom Pre-select for pop-up form

My implementation of a custom stylizable select for a form with the ability to add a preselection depending on which button has been clicked to open this form. Written in vanilla JS. All customizable class names are collected in variables.

This particular implementation assumes that you have three buttons (for three different cards offering three different price plans, for example). When you click on one of these buttons - corresponding to each data plan - a dropdown list (containing three options with text - one for each data plan: "First option", "Second option", "Third option") is pre-selected depending on which button was clicked.
